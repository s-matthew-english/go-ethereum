## GoEthe

This is a fork of the Ethereum protocol's official golang implementation.
The purpose of this code base is to provide a framework for testing the effectiveness of the EVM, particularly it has been augmented to track the execution time of individual opcodes.


# Commands: 

Start with this command:

```
./build/bin/geth datadir=/Users/s.matthew.english/Library/Ethereum/testnet console
```

As your node/EVM runs it will generate lots of output text so consider piping the output to a file.
